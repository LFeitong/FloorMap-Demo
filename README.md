## Developing and Running Locally

To get started, clone the repository and ensure you npm >= 3 and grunt installed, then run:

    npm install
    grunt

The latter command generates `example/js/blueprint3d.js` from `src`.

The easiest way to run locally is to run a local server from the `example` directory. There are plenty of options. One uses Python's built in webserver:

    cd example

    # Python 2.x
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

    # Python 3.x
    python -m http.server

Then, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
